# Discord Moderator Guidelines
While many of these things are common sense, they should still be incorporated into rules so that there is a clear expectation set among members as to how they should behave.

- ### **Doxxing/Harassment**: Threats and encouraging self harm aren't allowed.
- ### **Spamming/Phishing/Trying** to steal other's accounts aren't allowed.
